By its application, the Commission of the European Communities asks the Court to:

— declare that, by not taking all the measures necessary to comply with the

JUDGMENT OF 18. 7. 2006 — CASE C-119/04

—

order the Italian Republic to pay into the Commission's ‘European Community
own resources’ account, a penalty payment of EUR 309 750 for each day of delay
in taking the measures necessary to comply with the judgment in Case C-212/99
Commission v Italy, from the day on which judgment in the present case is
delivered until the judgment in that case is complied with;

— order the Italian Republic to pay the costs.

Legal context

Community legislation

2

Article 39(1) EC reads as follows:

‘Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Community.’

3

Under Article 39(2) EC, freedom of movement for workers is to entail the abolition
of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as
regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.

COMMISSION v ITALY

National legislation

4

On 14 January 2004, the Italian Government adopted Decree-Law No 2, laying down
urgent provisions relating to the economic treatment of linguistic associates in
certain universities and concerning equivalent qualifications (GURI No 11 of 15
January 2004, p. 4) (‘Decree-Law No 2/2004’).

5

Article 1(1) of Decree-Law No 2/2004 provides:

‘In compliance with the judgment delivered by the Court of Justice ... on 26 June
2001 in Case C-212/99, the financial treatment of linguistic associates, former
foreign-language assistants (the “former assistants”) at the universities of La
Basilicata, Milan, Palermo, Pisa,“La Sapienza” in Rome, and the Eastern University
Institute in Naples (“the universities in question”) ... shall correspond to that
afforded to part-time tenured researchers, on a pro rata basis according to the
number of hours worked and on the basis that full-time employment is equal to 500
hours per year, with effect from the original date of recruitment, save where more
advantageous treatment may be afforded; ...’

6

Under Article 1 of Decree-Law No 57 of 2 March 1987, converted into Law No 158
of 22 April 1987 (GURI No 51 of 3 March 1987) amending Article 32 of Decree of
the President of the Republic No 382 of 11 July 1980 (Ordinary Supplement to GURI
No 209 of 31 July 1980), the maximum number of teaching hours to be completed
each year by tenured researchers is 350 for a full-time post and 200 for a part-time
post. The salary of part-time tenured researchers is a standard figure, comprising
remuneration for 200 hours’ teaching and for an unspecified number of hours of
research.
I - 6903

JUDGMENT OF 18. 7. 2006 — CASE C-119/04

7

Article 51 of the 1994-1997 national collective employment agreement for
university staff (‘the CCNL’) provided that associates and mother-tongue linguistic
associates (‘associates and linguistic experts’) were to work 500 actual hours per
year. Derogations from that general reference framework were permitted.

The judgment of 26 June 2001 in Commission v Italy

8

At the first paragraph of the operative part of the judgment in Case C-212/99
Commission v Italy the Court declared that:

‘[b]y not guaranteeing recognition of the rights acquired by former ... assistants who
have become associates and ... linguistic experts, even though such recognition is
guaranteed to all national workers, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its
obligations under Article [39] EC’.

Pre-litigation procedure

9

By letter of 31 January 2002, the Commission reminded the Italian authorities that it
was necessary to comply with their obligations under the judgment in Case
C-212/99 Commission v Italy.
I - 6904

COMMISSION v ITALY

10

By letters of 10 April, 8 July and 16 October 2002, the Italian authorities replied to
that reminder letter by sending the Commission the following:

— a copy of a letter, dated 27 March 2002, by which the Minister for Education,
Universities and Scientific Research called upon the universities in question to
comply with the provisions of the judgment in Case C-212/99 within 45 days;

—

information concerning the measures adopted by those universities to ‘ensure

recognition of the length of service of … former assistants, on the basis of the
judgment delivered by the Court of Justice’;

— explanations as to the content and effects of the decisions taken by each of those
universities.

11

Following on from those communications, by letter of 11 December 2002, the
Commission requested clarification from the Italian authorities as to the method
and criteria used by the universities in question to calculate the increases in the
remuneration of former assistants who, since 1994, had formed part of a newlyestablished body of associates and linguistic experts.

12

The Italian Government replied to that request by letter of 24 January 2003, sending
the Commission a draft CCNL agreement — second two-year financial period 20002001 — signed on 18 December 2002 by the governmental agency responsible for
negotiating employment contracts in the public sector (ARAN) and by the trade
union organisations for university staff. That draft agreement contained specific
rules for associates and linguistic experts (former assistants) in order to ‘comply with
the judgment delivered by the Court of Justice on 26 June 2001 in Case C-212/99’.
I - 6905

JUDGMENT OF 18. 7. 2006 — CASE C-119/04

13

Since it considered that those measures did not demonstrate that the infringement
had been remedied, on 30 April 2003 the Commission sent the Italian Republic a
reasoned opinion in which it concluded that, by failing to take all the measures
necessary to comply with the judgment in Case C-212/99 Commission v Italy, that
Member State had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 39 EC. The
Commission drew the attention of that Member State to the fact that, if the dispute
were brought before the Court, it would seek an order for a penalty payment.
Further, the Italian Republic was required to adopt the necessary measures to
comply with the reasoned opinion within two months of its notification.

14

In response to that reasoned opinion, the Italian Government sent the Commission
a number of documents, including, inter alia, letters of 16 June and 12 November
2003, which, respectively, provided the Commission with the final version of the
CCNL, signed on 13 May 2003, and notified it of the measures the competent
authorities intended to take shortly thereafter. On 28 January 2004, that government
sent the Commission a copy of Decree-Law No 2/2004.

15

It was in those circumstances that the Commission, taking the view that the Italian
Republic had not fully complied with the judgment in Case C-212/99 Commission v
Italy, decided to bring the present action.

Failure to fulfil obligations

Arguments of the parties

16

The Commission points out that Article 22(3) of the final version of the CCNL
states that ‘upon further negotiation, the judgment delivered by the Court of Justice
I - 6906

COMMISSION v ITALY

… on 26 January 2001 in Case C-212/99 … will be given effect … by the drawing up
of a salary scale which will taken into account experience acquired in respect of the
category of [associates and linguistic experts]’. For the Commission, that final
version does not itself identify a category of workers whose functions can be
regarded as equivalent to those exercised by former assistants.

17

The Commission states, further, that Decree-Law No 2/2004 treats former assistants
in the same way as part-time tenured researchers. However, a full-time, foreignlanguage assistant should receive treatment equivalent to that of a full-time tenured
researcher, if the former is not to be disadvantaged with regard to arrears of salary
and retirement pension rights. The fact that former assistants were awarded pay
increases with effect from a certain date does not, of itself, mean that discrimination
based on nationality has been removed.

18

The Commission submits that the Italian Republic has failed to prove that the
universities paid all the arrears of salary and salary increases due or amounts on
account of the social security contributions to which former assistants were entitled
in view of the teaching hours they had actually worked.

19

The Italian Republic contends that the steps taken must be considered in the light of
the Italian system for regulating employment relationships, which is based on
collective agreement.

20

According to that Member State, the purpose of Decree-Law No 2/2004 was
specifically to deal with the deadlock reached in the collective negotiations within
the universities. To that end, that decree-law required the defaulting universities to
reconstruct the career of former assistants by taking the remuneration of part-time
tenured researchers as their standard of reference.
I - 6907

JUDGMENT OF 18. 7. 2006 — CASE C-119/04

21

The Italian authorities maintain that the choice of that category of national workers
is justified by the fact that it is not possible to treat the functions of a full-time
tenured researcher in the same way as those of a former assistant.

22

Firstly, the principal function of researchers is to carry out scientific research, whilst
teaching is merely a secondary, marginal feature of their work. To see it otherwise
would be to undervalue that part of a university researcher's remuneration that is
allocated for scientific research.

23

Secondly, the analogy drawn between former assistants and part-time tenured
researchers is essentially based on the fact that the employment relationship
between the latter and their employer lacks any exclusivity, which enables such
researchers to do other professional work.

24

In the circumstances, compliance with the judgment in Case C-212/99 Commission
v Italy required merely that the collective agreement concluded by the universities
in question be supplemented by an additional clause setting out the criteria to
ensure that former assistants could retain the rights they had acquired in the course
of their earlier employment relationships.

Findings of the Court

25

As a preliminary point, it is to be noted that a Member State cannot plead
provisions, practices or situations prevailing in its domestic legal order to justify
failure to observe obligations arising under Community law (see, inter alia, Case
C-212/99 Commission v Italy, paragraph 34, and Case C-195/02 Commission v Spain
[2004] ECR I-7857, paragraph 82).
I - 6908

COMMISSION v ITALY

26

The Italian Republic's argument that the problem of recognition of rights acquired
by former assistants must be considered in the light of the Italian system for
regulating employment relationships, which is based on collective agreement,
cannot, therefore, be accepted.

27

Further, according to settled case-law, the reference date for assessing whether there
has been a failure to fulfil obligations under Article 228 EC is the date of expiry of
the period prescribed in the reasoned opinion issued under that provision (see Case
C-304/02 Commission v France [2005] ECR I-6263, paragraph 30, and Case
C-177/04 Commission v France [2006] ECR I-2461, paragraph 20).

28

In the present case, it is common ground that, on the date of expiry of the period
prescribed in the reasoned opinion of 30 April 2003, the Italian Republic had not yet
taken all of the measures necessary to comply with the judgment in Case C-212/99
Commission v Italy.

29

As is clear from paragraphs 21 and 22 of the judgment in Case C-212/99
Commission v Italy, the principle of equal treatment laid down by Article 39 EC
required that, where former assistants who have been employed under a fixed-term
contract have that contract replaced by one of indeterminate duration, they should
retain all the rights acquired from the date of their original recruitment. That
guarantee had consequences not only with regard to increases in salary, but also
with regard to seniority and to payment by the employer of social security
contributions.

30

It is apparent from the file that, by way of compliance with the judgment in Case
C-212/99 Commission v Italy, as an initial step, the Italian Republic implemented
the following measures:

— at the University of Milan, a collective agreement concerning associates and
linguistic experts, signed on 27 November 1999, provided that work done by the
I - 6909

JUDGMENT OF 18. 7. 2006 — CASE C-119/04

latter as foreign-language assistants was to be taken into account for the
purposes of determining their remuneration. Subsequently, by letter of 7 May
2002, that university informed the Italian Government that the remuneration of
associates and linguistic experts had been increased and that arrears of salary
had been calculated on the basis of a maximum of 450 teaching hours per year;

— at the University of Pisa, by decision of the Administrative Director of 13 March
2002 and of the Rector of 10 May 2002, former assistants were to receive arrears
of salary on the basis of three seniority increments;

—

on 17 May 2002, a decision of the Administrative Director of ‘La Sapienza’
University in Rome established that the seniority of former assistants had been
calculated on the basis of an annual teaching commitment of 400 hours;

— the University of Palermo announced, by letter of 27 May 2002, that it intended
to bring up to date the remuneration of former assistants on the basis of
calculations that remained to be completed;

— by decision of the Rector of the Eastern University Institute in Naples of 20 May
2002, associates and linguistic experts received arrears of salary calculated on
the basis of a 318-hour annual teaching commitment;

— a decision of the Administrative Director of the University of La Basilicata of 22
May 2002 provided that the seniority of associates and linguistic experts was to
be determined on the basis of five increments and a standard annual teaching
commitment of 400 hours.
I - 6910

COMMISSION v ITALY

31

Those measures could not be regarded as either adequately or definitively complying
with the judgment in Case C-212/99 Commission v Italy and the Italian Government
itself did not regard them as so doing.

32

Therefore, notwithstanding the measures set out at paragraph 30 above, on the date
of the expiry of the period prescribed in the reasoned opinion, the Italian Republic
had still not complied with the judgment in question.

33

Since the Commission seeks the imposition of a penalty payment on the Italian
Republic, it must be ascertained whether the alleged breach of obligations has
continued up to the Court's examination of the facts (see Case C-304/02
Commission v France, paragraph 31, and Case C-177/04 Commission v France,
paragraph 21).

34

On 14 January 2004, the Italian Republic adopted Decree-Law No 2/2004, the
purpose of which was to provide the legal and financial framework necessary finally
to enable each of the universities in question to reconstruct precisely the career of
former assistants.

35

The legal framework laid down by Decree-Law No 2/2004 is based on two
principles, under which, save where more advantageous treatment may be afforded:

— the reconstruction of the career of former assistants was to be effected by taking
the remuneration of part-time tenured researchers as the standard of reference;
I - 6911

JUDGMENT OF 18. 7. 2006 — CASE C-119/04

— that remuneration was to be granted to former assistants on a pro rata basis
according to the number of hours worked and on the basis that full-time
employment was equal to 500 teaching hours a year.

36

The criterion of 500 hours per year is based on the number of hours worked by
associates and linguistic experts (former assistants) as provided for under the CCNL
for the period 1994 to 1997. It is an objective criterion which makes it possible to
deal with the difficulties inherent in assessing the careers of all former assistants on a
case by case basis. In that connection, it is sufficient to note that not all of the
universities indicated that they had collective agreements setting out the criteria
necessary for the precise reconstruction of the career of former assistants.

37

As to the choice of part-time tenured researchers as the appropriate national
reference category of national workers for reconstructing the career of former
assistants, such a choice is a matter for the national authorities. It does not follow
from the judgment in Case C-212/99 Commission v Italy that the Italian Republic
was required to identify a category of workers comparable to former assistants and
to treat the latter in exactly the same way as that category of workers.

38

In the light of the foregoing, the Court is not able, on the basis of the information
provided by the Commission, to establish that the criteria set out at paragraphs
36 and 37 above are inadequate, particularly so since it would appear that the
application of those criteria does not, in certain cases, preclude the career of a
former assistant from being reconstructed on more advantageous terms.
I - 6912

COMMISSION v ITALY

39

Decree-Law No 2/2004 cannot therefore be regarded as having provided an
incorrect legal framework for the purposes of enabling each of the universities in
question to reconstruct precisely the career of former assistants.

40

It remains to be ascertained whether the measures taken by the universities in
question after the adoption of Decree-Law No 2/2004 achieved the declared
objectives.

41

According to settled case-law, it is for the Commission to provide the Court, in the
course of these proceedings, with the information necessary to determine the extent
to which a Member State has complied with a judgment declaring it to be in breach
of its obligations (Case C-387/97 Commission v Greece [2000] ECR I-5047,
paragraph 73). Moreover, where the Commission has adduced sufficient evidence to
show that the breach of obligations has persisted, it is for the Member State
concerned to challenge in substance and in detail the information produced and its
consequences (Case C-304/02 Commission v France, paragraph 56).

42

In addition to the statements by the universities in question confirming that the
acquired rights of former assistants had been fully recognised, the Italian
Government produced detailed tables relating to how such recognition had been
put into effect in each of those universities.

43

Admittedly, the payment declarations in the file were produced by the universities
and not by the parties entitled and, in the case of the Eastern University Institute in
Naples, payment was to be made at a date after the month in which the declaration
itself was drawn up (October 2004).
I - 6913

JUDGMENT OF 18. 7. 2006 — CASE C-119/04

44

However, the information provided to the Court does not call into question the facts
set out at paragraph 42 above.

45

Accordingly, the Court does not have sufficient information to permit it to find that,
on the date of the Court's examination of the facts, the breach of obligations
persisted.

46

The imposition of a penalty payment is not, therefore, justified.

47

In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that, by not ensuring, at the date of
expiry of the period prescribed in the reasoned opinion, recognition of the rights
acquired by former assistants who have become associates and linguistic experts,
even though such recognition is guaranteed to all national workers, the Italian
Republic has failed to take all the measures necessary to comply with the judgment
in Case C-212/99 Commission v Italy and has therefore failed to fulfil its obligations
under Article 228 EC.

Costs

48

Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be
ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's
pleadings. Since the Commission applied for costs and the Italian Republic's failure
to fulfil its obligations has been established, the latter must be ordered to pay the
costs.
I - 6914

COMMISSION v ITALY

On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:

1.

By not ensuring, at the date of expiry of the period prescribed in the
reasoned opinion, recognition of the rights acquired by former assistants
who have become associates and linguistic experts, even though such
recognition is guaranteed to all national workers, the Italian Republic has
failed to take all the measures necessary to comply with the judgment of 26
June 2001 in Case C-212/99 Commission v Italy and has therefore failed to
fulfil its obligations under Article 228 EC.

2.

Dismisses the action as to the remainder.

3.

Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs.
